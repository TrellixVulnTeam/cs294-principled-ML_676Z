                        airplane: 10.00%

Learnability:
    Best guess accuracy:          10.00%
    Data Sufficiency:             Maybe enough data to generalize. [yellow]

Capacity Progression:             at [ 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, 100% ]
    Ideal Machine Learner:             13,  14,  15,  15,  16,  16




Expected Generalization:
    Decision Tree:                 3.88 bits/bit
    Neural Network:               10.02 bits/bit
    Random Forest:                 3.35 bits/bit

Expected Accuracy:              Training            Validation
    Decision Tree:                83.75%                12.09%
    Neural Network:                 ----                  ----
    Random Forest:               100.00%                40.30%

Recommendations:
    We recommend using Random Forest -f RF.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the effort option -e with a value of 5 or more to increase training time. 

Time to Build Estimates:
    Decision Tree:                less than a minute
