Learnability:
    Best guess accuracy:          10.00%
    Data Sufficiency:             Maybe enough data to generalize. [yellow]

Capacity Progression:             at [ 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, 100% ]
    Ideal Machine Learner:             13,  14,  15,  15,  16,  16




Expected Generalization:
    Decision Tree:                 3.78 bits/bit
    Neural Network:                3.37 bits/bit
    Random Forest:                 3.62 bits/bit

Expected Accuracy:              Training            Validation
    Decision Tree:                93.70%                11.39%
    Neural Network:                 ----                  ----
    Random Forest:               100.00%                44.76%

Recommendations:
    We recommend using Random Forest -f RF.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the effort option -e with a value of 5 or more to increase training time.
    Defaulting to RF model. Model can be forced with -f parameter.
