Pre-training Measurements
Data:
    Input:                      binaryset.csv (headerless csv)
    Target Column:              target
    Number of instances:      10000
    Number of attributes:      3072 out of 3072
    Number of classes:            2

Class Balance:                
                      automobile: 50.00%
                        airplane: 50.00%

Learnability:
    Best guess accuracy:          50.00%
    Data Sufficiency:             Not enough data to generalize. [red]

Capacity Progression:             at [ 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, 100% ]
    Ideal Machine Learner:              9,  10,  11,  11,  12,  13




Expected Generalization:
    Decision Tree:                 2.38 bits/bit
    Neural Network:                0.25 bits/bit
    Random Forest:                14.47 bits/bit

Expected Accuracy:              Training            Validation
    Decision Tree:                99.45%                57.71%
    Neural Network:                 ----                  ----
    Random Forest:               100.00%                86.20%

Recommendations:
    We recommend using Random Forest -f RF.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the effort option -e with a value of 5 or more to increase training time. 

Time to Build Estimates:
    Decision Tree:                less than a minute
